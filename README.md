The IoT Aquaculture Monitoring System is a smart solution designed to monitor and manage water quality parameters in fish farms and aquaculture ponds in real time.
By using IoT sensors and cloud-based monitoring, the system helps farmers maintain optimal water conditions, reduce fish mortality, and improve overall productivity.
This project automates data collection, visualization, and alerts, minimizing manual intervention and enabling data-driven decision making.
